## UX

### Project Purpose

The goal of CT's Housewares is to give the user an easy & hassle-free experience when purchasing houseware products, ensuring that all actions are made as quick, simple & effective as possible such as:

- Registration
- Log in
- Profile Information
- Finding a product
- Viewing brands of a product
- Finding product information
- Viewing product images
- Adding products to the cart
- Adjusting the quantity of item(s) in cart
- Removing item(s) from cart
- Easy payment process
- Order History

### User Experience

- Users get a great sense of usability from the get-go. They are presented with a burger icon at the top of
the screen for mobile & tablet display & a navigation bar on desktop display for a Search bar, Products, Cart, Login & Registration.

- A Carousel of brands has been included so the user can see what products the website has to offer from the get-go, the images of are also clickable & will navigate you to the product page & showing their respective brand.

- All cards on the product page have a clickable image, title which will take them to an individual product page where they can see more about the product including more images, a brief description, brand, item number, specifications & dimensions.

- Breadcrumbs have been included at the top of specific pages to help easily navigate back to pages
they have previously come from.

- Asterisks (Star symbols) have been included in both registration & login fields to indicate which fields are required to be filled in before submission. If a user has submitted a form without filling in a required field, validation has been included & will prompt the user to input any input field that is required.

- Pagination has been included in the products page to keep data cleaner & to limit the amount of data shown at one time, this can help quite substantially with loading time if there are lots of products.

- When the delete button is clicked on the recipe page, the user is presented with a modal to ensure they want to
delete their recipe permanently.

- The user does not need to click a back button or to reload the page. Easy and informative buttons have always been provided to ensure the user has an easy way around the website.

- Log in & Registration has been implemented into the website to create a sense of security to the website.


### User Stories

- #### As a user, I'd like to see:
    - A professional and strong looking website to draw the user into using the website.
    - Navigations which are simple & informative which don't leave the user unsure of how to get to the page they want to get to.
    - Images of the products that are available on the website as soon as a user goes to the website.
    - Buttons which are simple but informative & give a good indication of their purpose.
    - Subtle animations to not overcomplicate the website, but to give a strong professional look & feel.
    - Icons that give the user a better indication of what their specific action is.
    - I have all of the relevant information given to me at the appropriate time.


### Design Ideas

The design of the website was to give a clean & intuitive look & feel ensuring the user gets the best experience along with appropriate & catching imagery to draw the user in to making a purchase.

- #### Fonts

    - The font **'Roboto'** was chosen as the primary font to ensure it had a professional look.

- #### Colours

    - <div style="background-color: #666666; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid #000;"><div>
    <b>Hex Value: #666666;</b>

    This colour was used for the icons & text in the navbar.


    - <div style="background-color: #53a5e7; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid #000;"><div>

   <b>Hex Value: #53a5e7;</b>

    This colour was used for the logo, the footer, the payment progress bar & some of the buttons throughout the website. It was also used to colour the back to top button when you hover over it.


    - <div style="background-color: #218838; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid #000;"><div>

   <b>Hex Value: #218838;</b>

    This colour was used the "add to cart" button & the "checkout" button.


     - <div style="background-color: #ff0000; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid #000;"><div>

   <b>Hex Value: #ff0000;</b>

    This is used for the text when an item is out of stock & also used for the notification of how many items there are in you basket.


    - <div style="background-color: #fff; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid #000;"><div>

   <b>Hex Value: #fff;</b>

    This colour was used for the rest of the website including backgrounds & text when needed to contrast with backgrounds.
