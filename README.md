### User Experience

- Users get a great sense of usability from the get-go. They are presented with a burger icon at the top of
the screen for mobile & tablet display & a navigation bar on desktop display for a Search bar, Products, Cart, Login & Registration.

- A Carousel of brands has been included so the user can see what products the website has to offer from the get-go, the images of are also clickable & will navigate you to the product page & showing their respective brand.

- All cards on the product page have a clickable image, title which will take them to an individual product page where they can see more about the product including more images, a brief description, brand, item number, specifications & dimensions.

- Breadcrumbs have been included at the top of specific pages to help easily navigate back to pages
they have previously come from.

- Asterisks (Star symbols) have been included in both registration & login fields to indicate which fields are required to be filled in before submission. If a user has submitted a form without filling in a required field, validation has been included & will prompt the user to input any input field that is required.

- Pagination has been included in the products page to keep data cleaner & to limit the amount of data shown at one time, this can help quite substantially with loading time if there are lots of products.

- When the delete button is clicked on the recipe page, the user is presented with a modal to ensure they want to
delete their recipe permanently.

- The user does not need to click a back button or to reload the page. Easy and informative buttons have always been provided to ensure the user has an easy way around the website.

- Log in & Registration has been implemented into the website to create a sense of security to the website.
